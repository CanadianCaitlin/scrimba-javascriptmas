# 🎄 Scrimba's JavaScriptmas Advent Calendar 🎄

In order to practice and become more fluent in JavaScript, I'll be completing Scrimba's "24 Days of JavaScriptmas" and documenting my solutions in this repository.

I encourage any feedback or code review. Feel free to message me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlinawright/.

P.s. I  created this advent calendar in January. Who said the holidays were over? ⛄️
